>**Deprecation Notice:** This library is deprecated and will no longer be maintained or updated. Instead, it is recommended to use the [`ballerina/lang.regexp`](https://lib.ballerina.io/ballerina/lang.regexp/latest) library for continued support and updates. For more information, see the new [RegExp type example](https://ballerina.io/by-example/regexp-type), [RegExp operations example](https://ballerina.io/by-example/regexp-operations), and [Regular expressions feature guide](https://ballerina.io/learn/distinctive-language-features/advanced-general-purpose-language-features/#regular-expressions).

## Overview

This module provides APIs for searching, splitting, and replacing the set of characters of a string. These APIs are using a 
regular expression as a `String` to perform these operations by finding the string matches.

[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression), are notations for describing sets of 
character strings. If a particular string is in the set described by a regular expression, the regular expression matches that string.

For information on the operations, which you can perform with the regex module, see the below **Functions**.
